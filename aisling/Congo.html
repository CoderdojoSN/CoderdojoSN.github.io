 <h1>This is my project on The Democratic Republic of Congo.</h1><h3>I hope you enjoy</h3>
<p>We were told that we had to choose an African countrie.I chose The Democratic Rebublic of Congo because:
 <ul><li>It is a very big country and takes up a lot of Africa.</li>
 <li>I didnt know a lot about Congo</li>
 <li>I was very interested in learning about the country.</li></ul>
