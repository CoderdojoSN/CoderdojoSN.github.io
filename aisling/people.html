 <h1>People</h1>
 <p>Since Africa is in a completely different continent to us and very far away,so it has a completely different life-style to us.</p>
  <p>This is the people of Africa.</p>
  <p>Over 70% Congolese are Christians, the rest follow African religions, Islam and other beliefs. Around 68% work in agriculture, 19% in services and 13% in the 
  factories. Many people in rural areas live without electricity; water sources are mostly unprotected and often lead to contamination.
  Infections and parasitic diseases claim many lives, with a high rate of death for children under 5 years.</p>
  <h2>Greeting customs</h2>
  <p>A good greeting is to shake hands with your right hand. To show respect to important people people should
  hold their right forearm with their left hand while shaking hands. Men often share a touching of the sides 
  of their foreheads, first right than left. Holding hands between people of the same gender is a sign of friendship.When a man is greeting a woman it is best to wait for the
  woman to extend her hand. Young people wait for older people to offer their hand. If you are unsure how to pronounce your visitor's name,
  you may ask them what they prefer, or call the adult women "Madame" or "Mama" and the adult men 
  "Monsieur" or "Papa".</p><br>

 <p>Eye contact might be more indirect during a conversation; women and children might look down 
or away to show respect. It is best to avoid asking about someone’s ethnic history or talking about the civil war. Many lost loved ones. Good topics of conversation include food,
 sport (soccer), fashion, Congo's landscape, Australia, etc. most people dont see the importance with appointed times, they don’t tend to be on time. This is different
 in business situations where punctuality is valued.</p><br>
 <p>Congolese people have a set of gestures for pointing to and calling people. If you want to point to someone hold out the arm with the palm open and upward. It is considered 
very rude to point at a person with your index finger. Calling someone to come over is done by extending the arm with the palm turned down and bringing in the fingers towards you,
 like a scratching motion. People also have proper ways to give or receive things. Children learn to offer both hands when receiving an object, especially from an adult, which shows
 respect.</p><br>
 <h2>Family</h2>
  <p>The man is the head of the house but both the woman and the man make big decisions together although the man gets the final decision.</p>
  <p>Respect is one of the most important things to the Congolese people.Respect and obedience have similar meanings to the Congolese.Children are expected to never question 
    parental authority. Women do the housework and look after the children. The husband's role is to improve the families’ life. To get married one has to pay a price for his bride 
	to her family. A bride value today is usually paid in cash or goods.Children are a sign of wealth so families think of themselves blessed to have lots o children.</p><br>
<h2>Clothes</h2>
People take pride in their apperance and dress modestly.People have adapted western styles since they used to be assosiated with the west.
The traditional African sarong (a cloth wrap) or “pagne” is still worn by many women. These are often decorated with symbolic slogans or icons. Women also wear headscarves.
<h2>Food</h2>
 <p>Food gets traditionally eaten with one’s fingers. Before eating hands are washed in a basin of warm water. People eat beans, rice, fish and other vegetables with various sauces.
 For breakfast people in Congo often eat bread-like donuts dipped in a sauce or sugar. French bread, tea and coffee are popular too.</p><br>
